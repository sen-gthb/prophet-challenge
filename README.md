# prophet-challenge
In this challenge, we produce a time series model using Prophet modeling that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data to the company Mercado Libre's financial and user search data to look for opportunities for growth. We attempt to discover if we can predict stock trade successfully based on search traffic. This was completed independently as well as some parts in collaboration in student study groups.
