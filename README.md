# prophet-challenge
In this project, a time series model is created from a large data set using Prophet prediction modeling that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data to the company Mercado Libre's financial and user search data to look for opportunities for growth. Stock trades are than able to be predicted based on search traffic. This was completed independently as well as in collaboration in a student study group.
